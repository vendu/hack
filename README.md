This directory is a catch-all for some ideas for an FPGA-based computer
platform. At the moment, it is represented here for informational purposes only.

Ideas for Hardware
------------------
- simple 32-bit RISC CPU
- memory support for BRAM, SRAM, SDRAM
- 2 USB 2.0 ports
- I/O ports provided by the Papilio Arcade Megawing:
  - VGA - 4096 colors (see if it's possible/feasible to support 16-bit colors)
  - CD-quality stereo audio through 1/8" jack
- 2 DB9-ports for digital joysticks
- PS/2-ports for keyboard and mouse
- possible I/O not provided by the Arcade Megawing
  - RS-232 serial port with 16550 UART
- audio modules
  - possible hardware: SID MOS 6581, Gravis Ultrasound, Roland MT-32, AC97
- graphics support
  - blitter

Have fun,
