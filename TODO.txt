- investigate different FPGA memory architectures; BRAM, SRAM, DRAM
  - see about implementing a zone allocator
- make atomic operations optional [multicore]; perhaps add a thr-instruction
- see if it's feasible to implement a 16-bit DAC for VGA graphics or just use
  the 12-bit one provided by the Papilio Arcade Megawing
